        This is the building system for TaintTracking Pass, which is the content of term project for ECS 235B at
    University of California, Davis in Winter 2019.

        To build this pass, you need to have llvm installed in your computer. If you are using a Linux distribution,
    you are good. Once you are done with installing, type following commands in terminal,

            cd FinalProj
            mkdir build
            cd build
            cmake ..
            make
            cd ../TaintTracking/tool
            cargo build --release
            cd ../..

        When you have any C language source codes, you have to compile them with this pass. Type

            clang -Xclang -load -Xclang build/TaintTracking/libLLVMPassTaintTracking.so -c test/test.c
            cc -no-pie test/test.o TaintTracking/tool/target/release/libtool.so
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH=TaintTracking/tool/target/release/ ./a.out

        The execuatable will run with taint tracking analysis and print out the taints of each basic block!

        If you want to see the llvm assembly language, just type

            clang -O0 -emit-llvm test.c -c -o test.bc
            llvm-dis < test.bc

        No optimization can help understand!

        So far, this pass can only analyze codes without loop. A new version is coming soon!
